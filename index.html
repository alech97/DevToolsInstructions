	<p class='title'>How to edit webpages using DevTools</p>
	<p>DevTools is an amazing feature of the Google Chrome browser.  It allows developers to view and diagnose every piece of their web applications.  But even for non-developers, DevTools can be very useful.  Using DevTools, you can edit or change any aspect of a website on your local machine.  Your changes will be lost once you refresh the webpage, but that doesn’t mean learning DevTools doesn’t have its uses!</p>

	<h1>How to Read HTML</h1>
	<p>Before we begin, we must understand what HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is.  HTML tells a web browser how to organize and structure a website.  Some websites are entirely coded in HTML, but most are only partly HTML.</p>
	<h2>HTML Tags</h2>
	<p>Tags could be anything you find on a webpage, such as buttons, text, boxes, tables, or images.  Tags are written like so:</p>
	<!-- Tag values go here -->
	<p>Every webpage is structured with these tags:</p>
	<!-- HTML Example here -->
	<h2>Div</h2>
	<p>One of the most common and important tags is a div.  A div is used to organize and style a box of code.  You will notice that div’s are used extensively to group similar objects together.</p>
	<!-- DIV With code HERE -->
	<h1>Edit the HTML of a Website</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>On the Elements page, you should see a panel on the left containing HTML code.</li>
		<li>Hover over various lines in this panel.  You should notice that as you hover over different tags of code, Chrome will highlight the tag’s location on the page with colors.  Locate the div that we want to change.</li>
		<li>To open this div, click on the   icon to show its contents.</li>
		<li>You should see a p tagline containing the words “Here is a piece of text located within a div.  Let’s see how to change this to something else!”  If you do not, then there is a shortcut to locating tags within the HTML code: right-click on the sentence we want to change above and click Inspect to immediately locate it.</li>
		<li>To change the text, double-click on the sentence or right-click and click Edit Text</li>
		<li>Type in whatever you want to and press Enter.  The text should change on your webpage!</li>
	</ol>
	<h1>Edit the Style of a Website</h1>
	<p>Still on the Elements page, you should see the Styles panel on the right of the page.  This panel is used to edit the style of a tag.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>At the top of this panel, underneath “element.style {“, you should see “color: red”.  Click on “red”.</li>
		<li>Type in “green” and press Enter.  The text should now be green.</li>
		<li>A new line should appear under “color:green”.  If the new line disappears, click directly underneath “color” to make a text field appear again.</li>
		<li>Type “font-weight:bold” into the new line and press Enter.  The text should now be bolded!</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 3-4 with the following styles:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>font-size:30px</li>
			<li>font-family:Verdana</li>
			<li>font-variant:small-caps</li>
			<li>text-decoration:underline</li>
			<li>direction:rtl</li>
		</ul
		<li>The text should now be in a capitalized, larger, green, underlined, Verdana font from right-to-left.</li>
